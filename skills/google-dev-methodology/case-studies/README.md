# Case Studies - Continuous Learning

This directory collects real-world usage cases of the Google Development Methodology skill. Each case study helps improve the skill's effectiveness and provides reference for future similar tasks.

## Purpose

- **Learn from experience** - Capture what worked and what didn't
- **Improve decision making** - Build a knowledge base for similar tasks
- **Optimize strategies** - Refine subagent usage and time estimates
- **Share knowledge** - Help others facing similar challenges

## Case Study Template

When a task is completed successfully, the skill will prompt:

## How to Use Case Studies

### For Users
1. **Before starting a task** - Search for similar cases
2. **Review approach** - See what worked for similar tasks
3. **Estimate time** - Use actual data from similar cases
4. **Avoid pitfalls** - Learn from challenges others faced

### For Skill Improvement
1. **Update Decision Matrix** - Refine time estimates based on actual data
2. **Improve Subagent Strategy** - Optimize based on what worked
3. **Enhance Documentation** - Add clarifications based on common questions
4. **Expand Examples** - Add new patterns discovered
